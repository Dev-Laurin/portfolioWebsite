This is my website holding data on my professional
experience, education, and projects for job-seeking
purposes. It is my resume, but also has updates on current
projects I am working on. 

Currently the website will be re-made with Angular 5 with the Mean stack (MongoDB, Express, Angular5.0, Node).
