This is my website holding data on my professional
experience, education, and projects for job-seeking
purposes. It is my resume, but also has updates on current
projects I am working on. 

Currently the website will be re-made with Angular 5 with the Mean stack (MongoDB, Express, Angular5.0, Node). 

What I hope to display in this project: 
	-TDD
	-Good coding standards
	-Ledgible Code
	-Usability Focus
	-Pretty Design/Functionality
	-Mobile Friendly
	-Frontend/Backend ability
	-Server maintenance/Admin via Cloud
	-Ability to use bootstrap/web frameworks
